          <h2 class="h2 mt-5">Our Purpose</h2>
          <p class="p-bot mt-4">
            The purpose of Harvest Bible University is to help all churches and Christians fulfill the Great Commission of Jesus Christ throughout the world. Jesus said, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age (Matt. 28:18–20).<br /><br />
            Harvest Bible University helps Christians get the education they need by making Bible university affordable for people who are not able to pay thousands of dollars per year to attend a major Bible university. It makes Bible education available by its location right in the city. It makes Bible education achievable for people of all ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Harvest makes Bible education practical for those who want an education that focuses on training in the Bible, ministry, and the Christian life. And Harvest helps churches by developing loyal, competent members who will work with the pastor as he or she leads. Just what you’ve been looking for.
          </p>
          <h2 class="h2 mt-5">Our Philosophy</h2>
          <p class="p-bot mt-4">
            Harvest Bible University is interdenominational and has been established to work in concert with churches and other ministries in the area who want to see a rapid increase in the number and effectiveness of churches in the city.<br /><br />
            Harvest leaves people’s ethnicity and socioeconomic identity intact. It is a multi-ethnic school that helps each group develop its own approach to reaching its people for Christ. Harvest is designed for regular people who will never be able to afford a major Christian university education; for people who come from oral tradition cultures and therefore do not fit in well with the dominant academic establishment; and for people who have been “marginalized” by “the system” for any number of other reasons.<br /><br />
            Harvest is designed to develop character, Bible knowledge, relationship with God, and ministry competency. It uses only teachers who are spiritually mature and have ministries themselves; who teach from experience as well as academic preparation. Every teacher is gifted with the ability to make the classroom come alive, to cause learning and life-change right in the room with little outside homework needed. Harvest is designed for working people with families who are active in their own churches and, therefore, do not have great amounts of time for schooling.<br /><br />
            Harvest Bible University was founded in Los Angeles in 1994. It has since opened campuses in other cities in the United States and 24 other nations. Harvest students and teachers have planted over 1,000 churches since the university began.
          </p>
          <h2 class="h2 mt-5">Location & Facilities</h2>
          <p class="p-bot mt-4">

          </p>
          <h2 class="h2 mt-5">Affiliation</h2>
          <p class="p-bot mt-4">
            Harvest Bible University is a member of the Association of Christian Schools, International (ACSI) and the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE).
          </p>
          <h2 class="h2 mt-5">Accreditation</h2>
          <p class="p-bot mt-4">
            Harvest Bible University is fully accredited by Accrediting Commission International, an association of over three hundred Christian schools, colleges, universities, and seminaries in the United States and other nations.
          </p>
          <h2 class="h2 mt-5">Non-discrimination Policy</h2>
          <p class="p-bot mt-4">
            Harvest Bible University admits students of any race, color, or national or ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national or ethnic origin in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, and other school-administered programs.
          </p>
          <h2 class="h2 mt-5">Funding</h2>
          <p class="p-bot mt-4">
            “My God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:19). The great missionary Hudson Taylor said, “God’s work done in God’s way will never lack God’s supply. He is too wise a God to frustrate His purposes for lack of funds.” Harvest was raised up by the Lord, and He has always provided for it through the people He moves to give rather than through our trying to raise money. Since many of these people have asked if they can give electronically rather than by mailing a check, we are including this donate button.
